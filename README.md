# Introduction
This app was built with the MERN stack and the purpose is to track your expenses.

You can add and remove them and even change the currency from euros (â‚¬) to dollars ($).

# Setup Back-End

You must create a `.env` file in the root of the `backend` folder and include the following:

```
APP_PORT=4000
MONGO_DB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@expenses-app.av3xq.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

The `APP_PORT` is the port where the development server will run, and the `MONGO_DB_URI` is the connection string to your MongoDB Atlas cluster. Check https://www.mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/connect/ for more information. 

# Setup Front-End

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the `client` folder and include the following:

`VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api`

The `VITE_API_URL` is the Node API where you will do the requests, keep in mind this is only for local development.

# Starting the app

From a terminal, go to the `backend` folder and execute the following command and don't close it: `npm run dev`

You must repeat this process for the `client` folder: `npm run dev`

You will see that both, the front-end and the back-end server, are now running.
